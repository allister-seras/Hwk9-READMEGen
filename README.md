  ## Installation
  N/A

  ## Useage
  This program is used to quickly and easily generate a simple README.md file for programming projects. It is likely to be used for smaller projects as it does not have a comprehensive set of questions that may be present in a more complex application. To use one just needs to download the file, navigate to the correct folder, and run `node index` in their terminal and the questions to create teh markdown file will appear one at a time.
